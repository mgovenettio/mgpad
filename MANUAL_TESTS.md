# Manual Regression Checks

## List conversion from Markdown-style prefixes
Perform these steps in the editor to ensure converting Markdown-style list prefixes does not leave stray marker characters in the resulting list items:

1. Type `* text` and press Enter. Confirm the line becomes a bulleted list item reading `text` (no leading `* `) and the caret moves to the next empty list item.
2. Type `1. text` and press Enter. Confirm the line becomes a numbered list item reading `text` and the caret advances to a new numbered item.
3. Type `a. text` and press Enter. Confirm the line becomes a lettered list item reading `text` and the caret advances to the next lettered item.
